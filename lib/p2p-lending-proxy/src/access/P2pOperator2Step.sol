/**
 * @dev Contract module which provides access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (a P2pOperator) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * This extension of the {P2pOperator.sol} contract includes a two-step mechanism to transfer
 * P2pOperator, where the new P2pOperator must call {acceptP2pOperator} in order to replace the
 * old one. This can help prevent common mistakes, such as transfers of P2pOperator to
 * incorrect accounts, or to contracts that are unable to interact with the
 * permission system.
 *
 * The initial P2pOperator is specified at deployment time in the constructor for `P2pOperator.sol`. This
 * can later be changed with {transferP2pOperator} and {acceptP2pOperator}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available all functions
 * from parent (P2pOperator.sol).
